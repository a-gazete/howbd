<p align="right">In my Dad's (PBUH) memory. He is the one that gave me this angle, and many others in life.<br>
  “_Canımı sıkan bir şey olduğunda araştırırım bakarım ne canımı sıkıyor diye. Sonra ‘haa o kadar da kötü değilmiş, buna can sıkmaya değmez’ derim. Canımın sıkıntısı gider_ ”</p>

`Getting out of your comfort zone is courage. But then, you can organize. Work on it. 
This text tells my way of working it. It can be applied for any path of life yet to be discovered. But I'll use a biz-venture as an example, without restricting what I have to say. 

The context is **_a new path in life_**. Doesn't matter you've seen others walking it steady/for centuries – biz-ventures, marriage, starting schools, changing jobs, moving to a new apartment/town/country, taking up a hobby, .. . You can't yet see yourself there. You wanna walk it – the decision is there. But, you can't comfortably picture yourself in it for 30 consecutive seconds. And, this is after much research, talking to people who've done it((1)), and whatever resource you could think of till you're satisfied you exhausted them all. You still need a picture to start with. You do have all the info, but not the guts to act on it. 

My way of drawing such picture is drawing its boundaries and my way of doing it is "What's the worst that can happen."


Merely a list, mental or written out – whichever you're comfortable with, of things that can go bad and sink it for you all the way and beyond. Eg: – 

“
* can’t sell and loose what I invest 
* shipment problems – loose what I invest 
* wrong paperwork/red-tape – time/headache/penalty
* mistake in xyz operation – loose partners/market/image/respect
* weather changes and I loose my crops
* weather changes and I can’t find suppliers for abc
* won’t be able to compete with pqr – won’t be able to sell 
* ...

”

Spread it through days. List some "how/what bad can be", then write some more. Go sleep on it, then write more. Stretch your imagination on "how bad"– spend time in it, get a traction out of it then stretch more. All the way there is. Get it all out.  

Get a fresh angle on inspiration of another day/place .. write that too. Look it in the face, all the way deep, and write. Squeeze it all out – don't skip the tiniest drop. Don't leave anything out, and get yourself satisfied that you didn't. Take your time. Research/ask around as to this "how bad can be."
It's boring to think of it when it's fuzzy. But then looking at that thing in the face 30secs here, 2mins there then sleeping on it makes it sink bit by bit in your head for that final leap. Don't any push/blame yourself. Just do it. 

You’re just having a look at it by yourself. You don’t have to show it to anyone. But have it all there. By listing them down, you're transforming them into the material world from your thoughts. Putting something into words is the only way of getting them out into the world and seeing them there. Don't leave any of them in the hidden corners. As you do this, you'll see how they really are –  altogether and by themselves. And this gives you a very good picture.  By doing this, you’ll have hit 2 birds: 

1) Will get all those "daemon processes" running in the background in your head out there and they won't bother you anymore. They were running back there without any/useful form. They started out as necessary/useful triggers, but weren't getting anywhere–  were just burning energy.

2) You'll have analyzed it. You now know better where/which to act on, initial steps, where the gaps are .. . You’ll start saying yourself things like “no place in theory that they all can go bad” (and this is very accurate), “.. then I’d do this <some plan-B option occurs to you>..”, “..well, maybe I can get insurance but not that big a risk,  ”, “..let it sink, not that bad..”.. all finding a form/structure and no longer are noises on your thoughts. You can't even wait to act on it now, let alone courage. You gained the astronaut's angle – you’re on top of it all.

You're not manifesting the bad that can happen by doing all this. You're dispersing the fog. 
They were the energy-eating noises in your thinking. They all are now finding an organized form.

// You'll probably divert from that path – will decide not to take it after all. but you'll reach it after your leap and it'll be your/right decision.


Additional Notes 


Someone trusted can say "don't worry, it'll be alright" to replace that. Esply if s/he/they have the know-how or coverage of that path. That's a great comfort, but the same thing – "worst comes to worst, I can turn to him". That's extra, and is very precious to have – trusted people believing in you. Within it, giving you that vision-of-boundaries, where things sit/belong in the overall picture is an analysis tool. Gives you a v.good picture of it as a part of the whole, and helps you analyze, absorb and digest it so that you can take it up and live it more fully. 

When you're dedicated and/or desperate,  you have another kind of plus right off. Can even be a big negative that you are experiencing right now and wanna get out of. You want out of it no matter what, So you're automatically leaping over those supposedly-to-scare you in your new path, and this is a good very thing. You're turning a negative into positive. Using something bad as a motivation/push. Still with this, this technique would help organize your initial steps and entry strategies.   

More effective on control freak types on personality scala. There are people that decide-and-start, or even get-inspired-and-start without a moment in between. I can’t see these much useful in their dynamics. But then every person is unique. Never know what gets one inspired for what, if it does.


** talking to real people does a lot for me. but that click-in-the head is still yours. // you have to have that leap-- sparkle but you gotta have yourself well digested it. 

**you'll get used to it in time. It will be automatic in your thinking when you face such situations. It'll be a life-habit.
